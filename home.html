          About Me
        </h3>
       <div class='chunk'>
         <div>
           <p>
              My versatile academic and extracurricular background has provided me with a diverse skill set. 
              The three years of academic study that I devoted to engineering has allowed me to both approach computer 
              science with a unique perspective and apply varying methodologies to technological projects. Born in Sichuan, 
              China, I was adopted and brought to the United States when I was 8 months old—this part of my identity has deepened 
              my appreciation for helping others. Since pivoting towards computer science, I look forward to creating technology that 
              improves people’s quality of life.

          Persona Project: Surfing USA
        </h3>

        <div>
          <h5>Context</h5>
          <p> The goal of this project was to step into a user’s shoes and fully analyze and understand how and why they interacted 
            with the interface in a specific way. I did this by observing real users interacting with an interface, 
            a surfboard, and then interviewed these individuals about their experiences. Lastly, I created two personas based on these users, with 
            each persona describing specific actions and things that the user might say while using the interface. 
            In an effort to understand and empathize with a variety of users, I chose personas that were very different from each other
            Lastly, based on one of the personas that I had built, I illustrated a storyboard, detailing the user's full experience 
            that they might have with the interface. Through this exercise, I learned how to analyze and empathize with users, which is extremely 
            imoprtant in user interface design and determining how to improve an interface or product. 
          </p>
          <h5>Research</h5>
          <p> User research is very common in industry and academia. Observing and interviewing users is a great way to get first hand 
            information from the user's perspective to help us better understand their motvations, wants, and problems with using the 
            interface. Our audience for this project specifically, might be a Surf shop such as Wavestorm Surfboards. Wavestorms wants to 
            ensure happy customers and more purchases. To do this, they could interview and observe users using surfboards to try to get 
            insights into what users may be missing when using a surfboard. If something could be pinpointed, Wavestorm could attempt 
            to upgrade their surfboard design to include that feature. 
          </p>
          <h5>Design Iterations</h5>
          <p> 
            I personally wanted to choose an interface that was different or unusual. This is becuase I assumed that users would have less
            opninions regarding simpler, more commonplace interfaces. In contrast, the surfboard, as a more diverse interface used by 
            people of varying levels of skill, and background provided a great jumping off point, with lots of different details, challenges,
            and perspectives to consider. 
          </p>
          <h5>Conclusion</h5>
          <p> From this project I learned that there is much more to understanding and empathizing with users than meets the eye. It's not enough 
            to ask good quesitons; you must dig into those questions and unearth the meaning behind the users answers. You also have to take into 
            consideration things like interview bias. Additionally, it was extremely rewarding to see how all the pieces of the process fit together. 
            Finishing the storyboard really highlighted just how important each piece was, as each piece really informed how the storyboard 
            was made.

            Responsive Redesign Project: San Mateo Website
          </h3>
  
          <div>
            <h5>Context</h5>
            <p> The goal of this project was to practice the workflow of redesigning a simple website. Through this project, I gained the 
              skills necessary to analyze and identify flaws in an existing interface, 
              create low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes, and 
              build a responsive website based on those prototypes. This website is dedicated to San Mateo County citizens as a way of informing them of 
              current events, providing them with helpfpul resources, and harboring a strong sense of community.
              This project focused on identifying design and accessibility issues within the interface. This is extremely important because a 
              key part of design is designing for every user, not just your typical user. Because of this, it's important to think about how users
              who are visually impaired, for example, interact with your interface. Lastly, responsiveness is essential in this day and age,
              as screens come in so many different shapes and sizes. For the interface to be successful, it must be able to adapt and change 
              such that it follows design principles on any type of screen. 
            </p>
            <h5>Research</h5>
            <p> There is quite a lot of research being done to improve both accessibility and responsiveness. We now have tools such as WebAIM WAVE to 
              help designers assess the accessibility and usability of the interface. Additionally, we have tools like flexbox to help designers
              create responsive interfaces. Combining these things, our audience may be designers dedicated to increasing accessibility. 
              I would hope that they would be pleased with our project and attempts at redesigning interfaces to address these issues. 
              Alternatively, for my project specifically, the audience could be San Mateo County citizens who want a webiste that's easier 
              to navigate and obtain information.  
            </p>
            <h5>Design Iterations</h5>
            <p>
              I chose to include a navbar in my redesigned website so that the user would not be limited to a single webpage, while also being able 
              to navigate quickly and seamlessly to information that they would otherwise have to scroll down for. Having this feature allowed me to 
              include more white space inbetween sections, increasing readability and lessening the time it would take a user to find the link or piece 
              of information that they were looking for. I considered a table, but decided in organized blocks of lists because of the sheer 
              amount of links that needed to be included. A table or grid ended up looking extremly busy, with too many lines; therefore, 
              I went with the list option instead. I also considered including a contact form, instead of the email link, that the user could
              fill out. However, I decided to go in accordance with the original design, and list just the email link, in case there was a strong
              reason for that specific method of communication.
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
              This project really improved my skills in Balsamiq and Figma. Before this project, I hadn't used either technology before, so it was incredibly
              rewarding to create my prototypes using these softwares. I was so impressed with their functionality and how quickly and easily I could 
              create and change my prototypes to fit my exact needs. Additionally, I found it intriguing how difficult it can be to weight certain design 
              tradeoffs when you don't have all the information that you may want to have. Because I wasn't in contact with the designer of the original
              website, I couldn't ask them why they chose to do certain things over others. This made it hard to determine if I was choosing the correct
              design.

            Iterative Design Project: Kuleana
          </h3>
  
          <div>
            <h5>Context</h5>
            <p>  
              The goal of this project was to design an interface for an emerging startup. Our group chose to design a 
              website for Kuleana with the purpose of informing consumers about the product and company while providing 
              an easy way to purchase the tuna. Because we focused our design on being intuitive and simple, new and returning 
              customers will be impacted by having a faster experience purchasing the tuna. After many iterations of sketches and wireframes, 
              the project culminated in completing a final hifi mockup of what a website made for Kuleana might look like. We then conducted user 
              testing of this final prototype using the remote user testing service UserTesting.com.
              This project focused on how to iteratively design a website. In this day and age, the internet has become a global 
              powerhouse, and websites have become more and more commonplace with the advent and extreme growth of the internet.  
            </p>
            <h5>Research</h5>
            <p> 
              The audience for this project might be other smaller companies that would like to create a website to help 
              the company sell their product and interact with their users. A well designed, quality website could greatly 
              benefit a company's growth and financial success. More specific to our project, the audience would be the company of Kuleana, which 
              hopes to inform the public about their product and sell lots of high grade tuna through their website.
            </p>
            <h5>Design Iterations</h5>
            <p> With this project being focused on iterative design, we made considered a myriad of different design choices. 
              Generally when designing the prototypes, we deliberated over balancing functionality with eye-catching aesthetics. 
              Though certain pages can be enhanced with more animations, our tests revealed that the prototype’s 
              consistent structure and effects contributed to an intuitive user experience. Therefore, we would look to 
              add more descriptions and images to make our website more appealing and informative but be cautious of adding too many effects.
              Additionally, we decided to focus on making the interactions straight-forward and easy to use. For example, we provided explicit instructions 
              on hovering on our Mission page to eliminate any possible confusion. Furthermore, clickable elements would be enlarged and have a 
              green border upon hover to make it clear that they can be clicked.
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p> My biggest takeaway from this project is that every part of an interface must be intentional if you want the interface to be 
              consistent and as user friendly as possible. My group's biggest struggle was definitely balancing creativity and uniqueness with 
              consistency and readability. It's easy to want to make your website pop, but you always have to remember what the website is being 
              used for and whether the design choices that you're making are helping towards that goal.

            Virtual Reality Project: Katie's Picture Show
          </h3>
  
          <div>
            <h5>Context</h5>
            <p> This project took place over the course of a semester as an independent study style project. It focused on creating a 
              Virtual Reality experience in Unity while working in a scrum team, utilizing the Agile methods and methodologies. 
              Our project was based on the children's book Katie's Pictures Show, which features a young girl walking through a museum.
              The twist is that the young girl can step into the various paintings, that are displayed throughout the museum, and 
              interact with its contents. 
            </p>
            <h5>Research</h5>
            <p> Virtual reality is an ever expanding field that I'm really excited about. It has so many potential applications 
              that could be really powerful and beneficial. The audience for our project was our fellow classmates, who got to build off 
              of and be inspired by what we decided to create for our VR experience. This project was a great first dive into virtual 
              reality and we would love for more people to learn about it and get invovled with the technology. 
            </p>
            <h5>Design Iterations</h5>
            <p> One of the big design considerations for this project was deciding what the transition between spaces was going go be. 
              In our experience, the user started in a room that was modeled to look like a museum or art gallery. From there, 
              a user could teleport into paintings that hung on the wall of the gallery space. At first, the teleporting was just an intermediate
              black screen that would occur for a couple seconds while the user switched rooms. We decided that we wanted the experience 
              to be more intense and attempted to create the feeling of a user falling through space. This took a a lot of time, which ended up 
              being detrimental to some of the other parts of the project, but the transition ended up being implemented successfully, so we were 
              pleased with the result. 
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p> My biggest takeaway from this project was that with the explosion of the Internet, the sky is the limit with regards to self teaching. 
              With all of the tutorials and documentation on the Internet, it can be quite easy to learn new technologies. Before this project, 
              none of my group members, nor myself, had worked in Unity before. Through tutorials and other online resources, we managed to create 
              a fully functional virtual reality experience by the end of the semester.
